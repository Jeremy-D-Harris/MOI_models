# MOI_models
# 
We modeled several single-cycle infection outcomes from bulk cell
culture in which cells were infected with flu virus over a range of
multiplicity of infection (MOI). This work was originally submitted to
PLOS Pathogens and uploaded to BioRxiv (08/30/19):
https://doi.org/10.1101/752329

This folder contains the code for fitting models to data measuring four
different aspects of infection outcomes:

"cell_death" - code for fitting cell death and viral distribution models to data

"virus_produciton" - code for fitting virus production models to data 

"IFN_induction" - code for fitting IFN induction models to IFNL1 data 

"SIE" - code for fitting models to coinfection and superinfection data
